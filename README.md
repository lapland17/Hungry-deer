# Hungry-deer
This is my first proyect ever on Scratch.
The game starts by clicking the green flag. The deer sees an apple, which makes it hungry, 
and kindly asks the player to help it get to it. The player must answer yes or no. 
If the answer is yes, then the deer approaches the tree and the player must click on the apple
so that it can fall and the deer can eat it. If the answer is no, then the deer is disappointed and nothing else happens.
In both cases, the player must press the spacebar to restart the game.
